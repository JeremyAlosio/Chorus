In Progress/Incomplete

# Chorus

This is a project created to test the summation of my skills as a developer that I've built up over my time at Optum-United Health Care.

During the creation of it's predecessor, Symphony, there were a lot of growing pains and learning curves that were overcome. Chorus
is the recreation of Symphony with a lot more room for expandablity and ease of use. Better functionality, looks shinier, gotta have 
a new name.

Uses Selenium/Java and Cucumber
